# Movie Database Project

This project is a comprehensive movie database designed for a university assignment. It involves creating and managing a structured SQL database to store information about users, movies, ratings, threads, comments, watchlists, genres, production companies, and people involved in making movies.

## SQL Scripts

### Create Tables

The `create.sql` file contains the SQL commands to create all tables in the database. 

### Drop Tables
The `drop.sql` file contains the SQL commands to drop all tables, which is used to reset the database.

### Insert Data
The `insert.sql` file contains the SQL commands to insert sample data into the tables. This data populates the database with initial entries for testing and development purposes.

### Queries
The `queries.sql` file contains various SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from the database. These queries include creating views, selecting data based on specific conditions, and aggregating information.
